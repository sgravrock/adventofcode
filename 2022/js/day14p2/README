Preparation: `npm install`. You can skip this if you're planning to bring your
own web server and not planning to run the tests.

To run tests:

1. Run `npm test`.
2. Visit <http://localhost:8888>.

To run the simulation:

1. Run `npm run start` or otherwise serve the files with a web sever.
2. Visit the URL from step 1.
3. Paste in your puzzle input and click Go.

That the simulation takes a long time (~13 minutes for my puzzle input on an
Apple M1) unless you un-check "Animate progress (slower)". With that box
un-checked it finishes in well under a second.
