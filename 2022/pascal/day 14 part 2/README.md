In addition to the usual build steps, this program requires a resource file.
To set it up:

1. Copy `day 14 part 2.r` onto the Mac, converting line endings as usual.
2. Use SARez to compile `day 14 part 2.r` to `day 14 part 2.rsrc`.
3. In THINK Pascal, select Run-> Run Options and specify `day 14 part 2.rsrc`
   as the resource file.
